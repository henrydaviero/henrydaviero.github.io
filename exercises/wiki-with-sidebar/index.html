                        <h1>APPLE PIE</h1>
                        <h2>Basic Facts</h2>
                        <p>
                            An apple pie is a pie in which the principal filling
                            is apples. Apple pie is often served with whipped
                            cream, ice cream ("apple pie à la mode"), custard or
                            cheddar cheese. It is generally double-crusted, with
                            pastry both above and below the filling; the upper
                            crust may be solid or latticed (woven of crosswise
                            strips). The bottom crust may be baked separately
                            ("blind") to prevent it from getting soggy. Tarte
                            Tatin is baked with the crust on top, but served
                            with it on the bottom.

                            Originating in the 14th century in England, apple
                            pie recipes are now a standard part of cuisines in
                            many countries where apples grow. Apple pie is a
                            significant dessert in many countries, including the
                            United Kingdom, Eire, Sweden, Norway, Australia,
                            Germany, New Zealand, and the US.[4]

                    Apple pie can be made with many different sorts of apples.
                    The more popular cooking apples include Braeburn, Gala,
                    Cortland, Bramley, Empire, Northern Spy, Granny Smith, and
                    McIntosh.[5] The fruit for the pie can be fresh, canned, or
                    reconstituted from dried apples. Dried or preserved apples
                    were originally substituted only at times when fresh fruit
                    was unavailable. The basic ingredients of the filling are
                    sugar, butter, a thickener like cornstarch and an acidic
                    ingredient like lemon juice. Spices are added most commonly
                    cinnamon, nutmeg.[2] and lemon juice which is used to
                    prevent oxidation of the apples when macerating the filling.
                    Many older recipes call for honey in place of the
                    then-expensive sugar.[6]

                    Apple pie is often served à la mode, that is, topped with
                    ice cream.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In another serving style, a piece of sharp cheddar cheese
                    is placed on top of or alongside a slice of the finished
                    pie.[7][8][9] Apple pie with cheddar is popular in the
                    American Midwest and New England, particularly in Vermont,
                    where it is considered the state dish.[3] In the north of
                    England, Cheddar or Wensleydale cheese is often used
                </p>

                    The 14th century recipe collection the Forme of Cury gives
                    a recipe including good apples, good spices, figs, raisins
                    and pears in a cofyn, a casing of pastry. Saffron colours
                    the filling.

                    Lattice pastry styles were found from the 17th century
                    alongside the more traditional dome shaped pie crust.[15]
                    Modern English versions incorporate thick layers of
                    sweetened slices of, usually, Bramley apple; layered into a
                    dome shape to allow for downward shrinkage, and thus avoid a
                    saggy middle; then topped with butter or lard shortcrust
                    pastry; and baked until the apple filling is cooked.

                    In English-speaking countries, apple pie, often considered
                    a comfort food, is a popular dessert, eaten hot or cold, on
                    its own or with ice cream, double cream, or custard. Apple
                    pies are often sold as mini versions in multipacks.

                    Traditional Dutch apple pie comes in two varieties, a crumb
                    (appelkruimeltaart) and a lattice (appeltaart) style pie.
                    Both recipes are distinct in that they typically call for
                    flavourings of cinnamon and lemon juice to be added and
                    differ in texture, not taste.[18][19] Dutch apple pies may
                    include ingredients such as full-cream butter, raisins and
                    almond paste, in addition to ingredients such as apples and
                    sugar, which they have in common with other recipes
                </p>
                <p>
                    The basis of Dutch apple pie is a crust on the bottom and
                    around the edges. This crust is then filled with pieces or
                    slices of apple, usually a crisp and mildly tart variety
                    such as Goudreinet or Elstar. Cinnamon and sugar are
                    generally mixed in with the apple filling. Atop the filling,
                    strands of dough cover the pie in a lattice holding the
                    filling in place but keeping it visible or cover the pie
                    with crumbs. It can be eaten warm or cold, sometimes with a
                    dash of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. In the US,
                    "Dutch apple pie" refers specifically to the apple pie style
                    with a crumb, streusel, topping
                </p>

                    One kind of French style apple pie is very different
                    compared to the typical version of the sweet dessert.
                    Instead of it being right side up with crust on top and
                    bottom, it actually is upside down, with the fruit being
                    caramelised. This can be made not only with apples but other
                    fruits or vegetables as well, for example, pears or tomatoes
