                    Developing a classification of graffiti styles may seem a
                    daunting task. Graffiti developed over several decades but
                    this relatively short time span when compared to other art
                    forms does not seem to affect the richness of their
                    stylistic expressions. History of graffiti goes back to
                    Roman times, but these first graffiti scribbled on Roman
                    houses were not created with any aesthetic idea behind them
                    so they can’t be described as one of the graffiti styles.
                    In the 20th century graffiti are considered an urban art
                    form, but not by everyone. From the first widespread
                    appearance in New York subway to buildings and walls around
                    the city, graffiti had a bad reputation that often provoked
                    negative actions by the officials. Some of the early
                    graffiti masters were even incarcerated and persecuted for
                    their work, which was pronounced as vandalism by political
                    elites.

                <h3 class="subhead">Tags</h3>

                    A tag can be defined as a stylised signature of the
                    graffiti artist’s name, often done quickly on a public
                    surface.Tags are the most common style of graffiti and often
                     the starting point for new graffiti artists. Tags can be
                     found in every graffiti culture worldwide because they’re
                     the earliest method of modern-day graffiti – with graffiti
                     writers like Cornbread from Philadelphia being the first to
                      do a graffiti tag in 1965.

                <img

                <p>
                Throw-ups are a style of graffiti characterised by rounded
                bubble letters with minimal negative space painted quickly
                (or ‘thrown-up’) on a surface.The throw-up is usually the next
                progression from a tag. This comes as graffiti artists get more
                familiar with letter structures and strive for their names to
                be painted bigger, whilst also maintaining speed. By avoiding
                negative space, sharp edges and intricate details, throw-ups
                are able to be painted quickly. Throw-ups contain two colours
                of paint – one for the fill and one for the outline.

                Among the different styles displayed in large format, one of the
                 most iconic is undoubtedly the "Wildstyle" which emerged in the
                  1970s-1980s in New York and has become increasingly complex
                  over time in Europe. Here, tapering letters intertwine with
                  each other, and numerous graphic elements are incorporated
                  into the composition according to the effect desired by the
                  graffiti artist, such as arrows, points, serifs, and shadow
                  effects. As a result, this compact composition becomes almost
                  unreadable, and it is very difficult to identify the letters
                  that make it up. This wild style is therefore complicated to
                  read for the uninitiated due to its numerous depth and
                  thickness effects, but it should not be confused with the 3D
                  style that emerged in the 1990s. Among the most representative
                   artists of this bold and spectacular style are primarily the
                   artist Tracy 168, who is considered its initiator, and Phase
                   2, but also more contemporary international artists such as
                   Bates, Chips, Taste, Mist, Cren and Zurik.
