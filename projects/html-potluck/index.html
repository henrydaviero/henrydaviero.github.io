        <h4>SYNOPSIS</h4>
        <p>
            In this chilling adaptation of Stephen King's horror novel,
            withdrawn and sensitive teen Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) faces
            taunting from classmates at school and abuse from her fanatically
            pious mother (Piper Laurie) at home. When strange occurrences start
            happening around Carrie, she begins to suspect that she has
            supernatural powers. Invited to the prom by the empathetic Tommy
            Ross (William Katt), Carrie tries to let her guard down, but things
            eventually take a dark and violent turn.

        <h4>SYNOPSIS</h4>
        <p>
            Stand by Me is a 1986 American coming-of-age drama film[5] directed
            by Rob Reiner. Based on Stephen King's 1982 novella The Body, the
            film is set in the fictional town of Castle Rock, Oregon in 1959.
            Stand by Me stars Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and
            Jerry O'Connell as four boys who set out on a journey to find the
            dead body of a missing boy. The film's title is derived from the
            1961 song of the same name by Ben E. King, which plays during the
            film's closing credits. Stand by Me received positive reviews upon
            release and was a commercial success. The film was nominated for
            an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and for two Golden
            Globe Awards: One for Best Drama Motion Picture and one for Best
            Director. Rolling Stone has called Stand by Me "a staple of youthful
            nostalgia" and "the rare movie that necessarily gets better with
            time".
